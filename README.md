Following the architecture proposed by Garnelo et al. (2016) we will explore its transfer learning capabilities. When a new situation is encountered, the system needs to hypothesize or find similarities (objects or elements)  with previously encountered scenarios. This can be done by introducing separate Q-functions for each task and then  take the composition of the Q-functions (Niekerk et al. (2018)).

Garnelo et al. (2016) experiment with a toy example having only two types of components/objects (positive and negative). If the system is able to classify different types of positive and negative objects, it would be a step towards solving the task of combining various objects into categories (a task at which humans excel). Ideally, the agent would then be able to solve new tasks without training/learning.
